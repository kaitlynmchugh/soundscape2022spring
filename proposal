My audio narrative will be set in a lively amusement park in October, nearing Halloween. The story revolves around a group of friends looking for the best scares in the park, which will be full of various actors (creepy clowns with the accompanying horn/squeaky nose, chilling dolls who, of course, want to play with you, and the classic chainsaw-wielding maniac), as well as different themed walkthroughs/houses (an abandoned asylum, Dracula’s castle, a deadly funhouse, etc.). As the friends decide to entire one of these seemingly deserted houses, hidden away at the back of the park, they are not prepared for what they face inside… 
(I haven’t decided whether I will take a more strictly horror approach for the end of the story, or whether I will keep it wholesome while teasing some of those horror themes.)
