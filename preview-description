The progress I've made on my audio narrative thus far has focused on the ambience of the location we're in: a theme park around Halloween/October, rather than the plot of the narrative. I've included some general dark background music, along with some typical sounds you would hear at a theme park/Halloween event. There are people yelling on roller coasters, a carousel running, general murmuring of crowds waiting in line for rides/food/houses, as well as some scare actors. I've included some chainsaw sounds and people screaming to mimic their reactions to the scare actors in the park. 

Most of my work so far has been limited to finding these sounds and compiling them into this project, so the relative volumes and placements of each sound definitely need adjusting. I'm hoping to mimic the effect of our characters walking through the park, with these sounds fading in and out of the background as they pass by, so most of the sounds have those effects (fade in/fade out) applied, but they also still need to be adjusted/optimized. 

I still need to work on recording all of the sounds I will source myself, including the dialogue of the main characters, scare actors, and background characters. 

The narrative will be driven by the conversation between the main characters as they walk through the park, who will be voiced by my roommates and I. While they are walking through the park, they will run into various actors and employees (also voiced by my roommates). These employees may be trying to sell them something like fresh popcorn or hot apple cider, while the scare actors will try to get the best reaction out of our characters. However, these characters are searching for the *best* scares in the park. Their journey through the park will lead them to a very old and haunting building, which they, of course, choose to enter.
