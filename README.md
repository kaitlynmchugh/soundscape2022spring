# Last Night at Slashfest 

Welcome to Slashfest! 
*Home of the best food and best scares in the entire continental USA*

At Slashfest, you'll find everything the horror-lovers and thrill-seekers in your life could ever need. When you step into the park, you will be immersed in what can only be described as a Halloween-wonderland. As you wander through the variety of houses we've set up this season, featuring *Asylum of Abandon*, *Nightmare in the Swamp*, and the newly improved and relocated *Funhouse of Terror*, watch out for any escaped inmates, rogue clowns, and chainsaw-wielding maniacs that may be lurking anywhere in the park. If you'd rather chase thrills than ghosts, check out our new steel coaster *Demon Slayer*, or the family favorite *Ghost Gliders*. Don't forget to try some of our famous freshly popped kettle-corn, fried funnel cake, and our locally sourced hot apple cider. Open now until October 31st! 

#

When Erin and Zak arrive at Slashfest, they're seeking something much more exciting than jump scares, coasters, and clown costumes. After hearing rumors of the old funhouse being haunted, they decide to take a paranormal investigation into their own hands. Will they emerge with compelling evidence of the paranormal, or will they join the cast of characters tasked with terrifying the guests of Slashfest, forever?

# Reflection 

Since this was my first time using Audacity and first time creating an audio narrative, I was conflicted about what theme to use for the narrative. I love anything of the horror genre, whether it's movies, games, or books, but I was skeptical that I could create a narrative that made sense using only sound. However, I still decided to go with the theme of a haunted building inside of a theme park around Halloween. I chose this theme because I have worked as an actor at a haunted house/Halloween attraction, and I think the sounds heard throughout a day in these kinds of places are so unique and interesting, so I thought I could build off of it. 

I think I succeeded in meeting the minimum criteria for this project. All of the dialogue was recorded by me and my roommates, with permission given by the voice actors Adam Starr and Gabby Etzel. The other sounds were sourced from freesound or Youtube Audio Library. A full list of citations and licenses can be found in the assets file, or above in the README file. 

As shown in the screenshot below, I have three layers of sound overlapping multiple times. In the opening, the music and the sound of the crowd provide a foundation for the narrative, while the extra sounds sprinkled on top like the popcorn machine, chainsaws/screams, and roller coasters, define the space as a theme park. 
![overlay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/152582127-144109ae-3251-42a8-9652-476ef0135a86.PNG)

I also exported the completed narrative as both an Audacity file and mp3 format. 

During the narrative, the story transitions from the characters beginning a hopeful investigation of the supposedly haunted funhouse and ends on a very different, but still open, note. The first big change in the story occurs when they first enter the funhouse and the atmosphere becomes much darker, with the fading out of the music and crowds. Then, Erin loses contact with Zak, and a ghost reveals that he’s gone. The audience is held in suspense until the ghost reveals that Erin is next. Although the narrative is certainly up to interpretation, my personal interpretation and intent was to tell the audience that Erin and Zak have met their end, by the girl that haunts the old funhouse. This story takes place in just over 3 minutes. 

In the narrative, I used a variety of effects to create the intended atmosphere. Since I’ve never used Audacity before, all the effects were new to me. Since this is a horror story, I definitely knew I ran the risk of overdoing it on the effects, so I mostly kept it simple by using the left and right pan features, along with some Fade In/Fade Out for the music and other sounds to keep the transitions smooth. I think the aspect that I had the most fun with was using the left/right pan to create a sense of location. Initially, I used it to show how different sounds were coming from different areas of the park, as well as making them quieter as the characters walked farther from the main park, but my favorite use of these features comes at the end of the story. The door slam occurs to the left, intended to be behind the characters, however; the ghost in the story enters with a giggle and speaks from the right. This is meant to show that whoever is closing the doors, giggling, speaking is very powerful and can basically teleport, or is maybe just very fast. 
![pan and transitions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/152581913-551caf44-4fd9-4171-a314-01009adb41cd.PNG)

This screenshot also shows my favorite transition in the narrative. I think the slow buildup after the ghost says “Zak’s gone” to finally saying “You’re next” helps to build suspension. I actually almost ended on the “you’re next” because I liked the transition so much and Gabby did such a good job capturing the creepy energy of the whisper I was looking for! Another one of my favorite transitions occurs when the music fades out and the creak of the door starts, to show that the characters are entering the old funhouse. I like that the second soundtrack doesn't begin and there’s a little bit of silence as the characters enter the new area. 

The main piece of advice I took away from the peer review was the idea of changing the music. I decided to switch from a slower/darker song to straight carnival music/background noise. I think this change will help the audience to stay more focused on dialogue and background noises rather than being overwhelmed by the background music, which really just serves to set the scene. 

Peer Review 1: 
![review 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/152581700-9ccff01d-4db6-4bd2-aeaa-e3d4868472b4.PNG)


The second peer review inspired me to add even more background noises to really make the listeners feel immersed in the theme park. I added footsteps to show that the characters are approaching and continued them during the parts I imagined them walking. I also added crunching of popcorn shortly after we hear the popcorn machine in the background. Finally, I decided to add another “actor” in the park just to see how many sounds I could really add to the background. She is meant to be a creepy doll, who seems innocent enough at first. 

Peer Review 2: 
![review 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75503004/152581628-537a725b-1411-4b0e-a0e7-33a1da6ffa08.PNG)


I think the most useful piece of advice I found in the articles we read, specifically “6 NPR stories that breathe life into neighborhood scenes” by Alison MacAdam, was to plot a route through the area you’re in. This piece of advice really helped me to create a plot for my narrative, as well as to include all of the sounds I wanted to. If the characters were stationary in the park, I feel like it could have been very chaotic and confusing with differences in volumes/location of all the sounds. 

Finally, I feel like I satisfied the baseline criteria and many of the aspirational criteria. I was honestly surprised at how my project came together, and how it compares to how I initially thought it would sound. I wasn’t sure if I could produce the environment and suspense that I wanted in creating something horror, but I’m happy with the final product.

# Project 1: Audio Narrative

Your task in this unit is to **arrange layers of sound to convey a sense of place and story.** In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to capture sound and edit it using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of sound as a medium, with particular attention to its ability to communicate *immersive environment* and *narrative pacing and change*. The genre of the narrative you convey is open: it could be documentary, fictional, even science-fictional. (The title you choose will help steer listeners' expectations, and thus their perceptions.)

As you start planning your composition, consider: in what place (physical, virtual, or imaginary) could you anchor your soundscape? What kinds of stories happen there, and which of them could you reasonably tell within a few minutes? How can you represent that environment sonically? What sounds are relatively stable, or sustained, and what is incidental? What structures or sequences could help a listening audience follow?

You don't need answers to all of these questions before getting started, but asking them early and returning to them often could help you get a sense of the soundscape you want to make.

## Generative constraints
_(to be updated together in lesson 6)_

### Baseline Criteria
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
* Play for 2-4 minutes
* Have something change from the beginning to the end of the piece
* Contain at least one sound originally recorded by you
* Contain at least one sound not recorded by you, but which you have permission (e.g. Creative Commons license, fair use, etc) to use
* List and credit file sources used, including your means of establishing permission
* Have three layers (tracks) of sound overlapping at least once in the file
* Meet deadlines and requirements from the chart below (see: citation, reflection, project title in README)
* Export a playable ("rendered") .mp3 file


### Aspirational Inspirations
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may…
* Use relative volume and other effects to signal distance
* Use left/right pan and low/high pass filters to create a sense of (locations in) space
* Use clear speech, if speech is used
* Have a clear organizational scheme you can articulate
  - e.g. Transition seamlessly from clip to clip
  - e.g. Use sharp cuts to signal scene changes
  * Have an emotional or intellectual intention that you can articulate
* Show evidence (e.g. from workshop notes) that audience interpretation matches what you intended
* Use Audacity effects that are new to you


## Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to your own copy of this assignment repository. I recommend that you **save often, using meaningful commit messages**; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).

## Setup

1. Fork this repository to create a new version you can control.
2. This will give you an online copy, but for editing purposes you'll definitely want a local copy on your computer. [Follow the cloning instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for your operating system, making sure to put the cloned folder in a place on your computer where you can easily find it.
<!--3. _Optional:_ Because some sound files can take up a lot of space, you may want to use [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/), an add-on service that lets you designate certain file extensions as worth tracking and storing off-site, rather than directly in your repository.
   * If you want to do this, it's pretty easy! You'll just need to install the LFS service at the command line to make it work.
   * Simply go to https://git-lfs.github.com, download, and follow the two steps on the screen!
   * Once it's set up at the command line, git-lfs will also work through GitHub Desktop.-->

## Parachute Prompts

As it says above, the genre, subject, and setting for this project are up to you. But if you're stuck for where to start, try one of these options:

* **Day in the Life of...** Over the course of a few days, record 40 or more 5-second snippets of sound that tell us where you are and what you're doing. (The challenge will be to make at least some of these sounds different from everyone else's: parts of a particular soundscape, not a generic one.) Overlay a soundtrack that shows your energy – or the energy you'd like to have; fiction is fair game, after all – at various times of day. *Human voices, including yours, are welcome!*
* **Interview for a Podcast** You know that one friend or family member who's always telling great stories? Ask them for a new one, or to re-tell one of your favorites, and this time, get it on "tape." Record more than you'll need, then go to the editing room to recreate the story in sound: boil it down to highlights, introduce your speaker and yourself, then add a background track and incidentals to round out the sonic atmosphere. To really get that journalistic feel, feel free to record commentary as you listen back, and interject the "present" you with the "past" you talking to your interviewee.
